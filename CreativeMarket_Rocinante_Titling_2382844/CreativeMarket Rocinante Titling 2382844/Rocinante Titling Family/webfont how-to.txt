/* 
these @font-face rules tell your CSS document where your font files are and what format the files are.

replace the type/ directory with wherever you decide to keep your font files.

WOFF2 is a next-generation version of WOFF, with smaller filesizesâ€”it's on the horizon, but is not yet supported in all browsers.

EOT files are for older versions of Internet Explorer.
